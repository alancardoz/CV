<h3>Introduction</h3>

  <p>My understanding of a website is something that we use to access information online any person, company, topic, subject, etc. that interests us. When we visit a website we can have access various types of information by clicking on various links/tabs/images/videos/buttons, etc. We can even enter our or any other details in text boxes and forms whenever a website asks us or prompts us to do so. Some of these textboxes can be encrypted such as password boxes.</p>
  <p>Whatever we see on a website is the frontend part of it. However, there is a lot which goes on behind the scenes of a website which is coded by website designers and developers. The website designers and developers mostly use the following:</p>
  <table cellspacing="10">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Text Editor</strong></td>
        <td>Atom, Notepad++, VSCode, Microsoft Expression Web, Sublime Text Build, Brackets, etc.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Web Browser</strong></td>
        <td>Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, etc.(Plz. note - Internet Explorer is highly not recommended).</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Coding Tool</strong></td>
        <td>HTML5(is the latest version), CSS3 (is the latest version), JavaScript, etc.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <h4>What is HTML?</h4>
  <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a coding tool which is responsible for the basic structure of the a website. It is used to include an image, a button, a textbox, a form, a link, a heading, etc., on our website. At the time of creating this in the month of June/July of the Gregorian year 2020, the latest version of HTML is HTML 5.</p>
