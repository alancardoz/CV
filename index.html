      <p>I am an electric bass guitar player from a place called Kanjur Marg in Mumbai, India. I have been performing with Mumbai based bands performing for weddings, coporates, hotels, socials, ect. I play covers of various genres ranging from pop,
        rock'n'roll, reggae, dance, etc. I have also taught school children to sing western songs as well as taught people of all ages to play guitar. Of late I have also started learning to play the keyboard and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-anokVTXpw">double bass guitar</a>. I have also
        developed a keen interest in online research on various subjects. I am also currently pursuing M.A. in Education from the Institute of Distance and Open Learning which is affiliated to Mumbai University</p></td>
